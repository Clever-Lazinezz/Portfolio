This project consist of four unique scripts. The goal is to prank a friend or use it on yourself. Ultimately, I wanted
to practice programming os manipulation scripts in Python and C. For an overview of each script and the intended 
function/order of these scripts, please read the Terminal Projects Outline.docx.

NOTE: These programs were written and tested on a mac. While the libraries used should adjust for the operating system 
of your device, it's possible windows or linux users may run into some issues.
