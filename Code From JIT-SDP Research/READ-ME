I created these scripts to load, transform, and confirm data in preparation for data analysis and exploratory machine
learning model. Furthermore, youâ€™ll find a script for visualizing some attribute distributions and a random forest 
machine learning model. Please note: data for these scripts can be found in the data folder

Research Abstract:
Software defect prediction (SDP) is a technique that aims to predict which parts of a software system are most likely
to contain defects or errors and prioritize testing and debugging efforts accordingly. A variant of SDP commonly 
referred to as Just-In-Time SDP (JIT-SDP) aims to identify and prioritize potential defects in software code as they 
are being written rather than waiting until the end of a development cycle to identify and fix them. JIT-SDP is 
typically based on data mining and machine learning techniques, which analyze historical data on defects and other 
relevant factors to build predictive models. Despite the benefits of JIT-SDP, it is rarely used in practice due to 
poor predictive performance, which leads to many false positives and can cause developers to reject the tool. 
Researchers have attempted to improve the predictive performance of JIT-SDP by designing deep-learning models, but 
the improvement has been marginal at best. We divided software changeset data based on software change metric values, 
create strata based on a prediction percentage range, and evaluated how well our model predicts particular defects. 
However, our experiments created inconclusive results.
