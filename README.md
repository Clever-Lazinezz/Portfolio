Hi, 

My name is Jordan Angus, and I'm a Macaulay Honors College student @ Brooklyn College. 
I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in data science. I've always been interested 
in science. Some of my first experiments were building solid and liquid fuel rockets. In high 
school, I focused on chemistry and even won 3rd place in my division's Science Olympiad "The 
Sounds of Music" event. I loved chemistry because it was difficult and applied to 
every other scientific discipline. Now that I'm a third-year college student, I've fallen 
in love with Data Engineering and Analytics. EVERY SINGLE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM DATA. Instead 
of going into details here, I want to use this repository to post a few of my most up-to-date 
projects. These projects will include Data Analysis(Python & R), Queries(SQL), and 
Infrastructures and Pipelines(Java & Apache Spark(to be learned)). Please take the time
to review my work.

The Best,
Jordan
